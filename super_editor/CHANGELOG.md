## [0.3.0-dev.51]

## [0.3.0-dev.50]
### Feb 24, 2026

## [0.3.0-dev.49]
### Feb 19, 2026

* FIX: Get builds on web working again by conditionally exporting test dependencies.

## [0.3.0-dev.47]

## [0.3.0-dev.46]
### Dec 13, 2025
* FIX: When pasting structured content, the first pasted node was getting lost.
* FIX: When pasting structured content, if pasting a single non-text node, an extra blank paragraph was retained above it.
* ADJUSTMENT: Implements content equivalency check for `TableBlockNode`.

## [0.3.0-dev.45]
### Dec 10, 2025
* ADJUSTMENT: Make Android mobile handles use an eager gesture recognizer so that things like
  drawers don't beat the handle drag gestures.
* FIX: `SuperEditor` - When the Android handles change the selection, `SuperEditor` now passes
  the correct "selection change type". Previously it was always hard-coded to "push caret".
* FIX: `SuperMessage` - Re-render visual styles when the incoming `styles` property changes.

## [0.3.0-dev.44]
### Dec 8, 2025
* FEATURE: Add mobile handle, magnifier, and toolbar to `SuperMessage`.
* BREAKING: Rename `DocumentKeyboardAction` to `SuperEditorKeyboardAction`, also created a different definition 
  for `DocumentKeyboardAction`
* ADJUSTMENT: Moved a bunch of test tools from `/test` and `/test_goldens` directory into the `/lib`.

## [0.3.0-dev.43]
### Dec 2, 2025
* FIX: `ImeFocusPolicy` wasn't unregistering its focus listener on disposal. This could result in a
  defunct `ImeFocusPolicy` responding to focus changes as if it still existed, interfering with a new,
  visible `SuperEditor`.

## [0.3.0-dev.42]
### Nov 26, 2025
* ADJUSTMENT: `MarkdownTableComponent`s now let you specify a column width policy, and a fit policy.
* FEATURE: Added a `GlobalScrollLock` to prevent two-dimensional scrolling with trackpad and Magic Mouse
  when the user expects only a single axis to scroll. E.g., scrolling a document vertically vs scrolling
  a table component horizontally.
  * Used by `SingleAxisTrackpadAndWheelScroller` to implement single-axis trackpad and scroll wheel scrolling.
  * Override your existing gesture-based scrollables with a `DeferToTrackpadsAndMouseWheelsScrollBehavior` to
    get them to defer to the `GlobalScrollLock`, too.

## [0.3.0-dev.41]
### Nov 24, 2025
* BREAKING: Centralized all `SuperEditor` IME connections. This change was made in an attempt to fix
            some non-reproducible issues where the IME keyboard would lose connection to a `SuperEditor`.
   * To upgrade to this version, you need to give each of your `SuperEditor` widgets a unique `inputRole`.
     The specific value of the `inputRole` doesn't matter, so long as different `SuperEditor`s in your app
     use different values.
* BREAKING: Moved all `super_editor_quill` code into `super_editor`. Will now
  deprecate `super_editor_quill` in favor of just using `super_editor`.
* FEATURE: Create a `SuperMessage` widget, which is an intrinsically sized document, like a
  `SuperReader` with intrinsic sizing and no scrolling. Made for chat use-cases.

## [0.3.0-dev.40]
### Nov 13, 2025
* BREAKING: Moved all `super_editor_markdown` code into `super_editor`. Will now
   deprecate `super_editor_markdown` in favor of just using `super_editor`.

## [0.3.0-dev.39]
### Nov 13, 2025
* FIX: `MessagePageScaffold` bottom sheet animation glitches fixed.
* ADJUSTMENT: `MessagePageScaffold` now has an optional maximum intrinsic height when 
   not in "expanded" mode.
* FIX: When an `Editable` or listener responding to an `Editable` can now immediately 
   submit `Editor` requests without blowing up.
* ADJUSTMENT: Don't require a `MutableDocument` or `MutableDocumentComposer` when calling
   `createDefaultEditor()`.
* FIX: Move remaining `OverlayController.show()` calls to post frame callbacks.

## [0.3.0-dev.38]
### Nov 9, 2025
* BREAKING, FIX: Rework `SuperEditorPlugin` lifecycle because we discovered that when
   one `SuperEditor` widget gets replaced by another, the new widget runs `initState()`
   before the old widget runs `dispose()`. This resulted in plugins ending up in a detached
   state when they should have been attached. This release adds some reference counting
   so that detachment only happens when it truly should.
* BREAKING, ADJUSTMENT: Related to the plugin lifecycle work, `EditContext.remove()` was
   adjusted to prevent accidentally removing a resource that was just added. The API change
   now expects you to pass the key to remove, and the value you want to remove for that key.
   If the current value doesn't match what is provided, then the removal doesn't happen.

## [0.3.0-dev.37]
### Nov 5, 2025

## [0.3.0-dev.1]
### June 10, 2024
MAJOR UPDATE: First taste of the new editor pipeline. 

This is a dev release so that you can begin to see the changes coming in the next major version. 
This release comes with numerous and significant breaking changes. As we get closer to stability 
for the next release, we'll add website guides to help update all of our users. 

The primary features that we've been working on since last release include:
 * Undo/Redo
 * A stable edit pipeline: requests > commands > change list > reactions > listeners
 * Common reaction features, e.g., hash tags and user tagging

In addition to the major feature work, we've made hundreds of little adjustments, including bugfixes.

We expect a steady stream of dev releases from this point forward, until we reach `v0.3.0`.

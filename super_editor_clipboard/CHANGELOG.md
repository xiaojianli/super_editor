## [0.2.10]
### March 28, 2026
* Adjustment: Updated `super_keyboard` dep to `v0.4.0`.

## [0.2.9]
### Feb 25, 2026
* Feature: Added Markdown to the series of default clipboard paste behaviors that is attempted when
  pasting from the native clipboard.
* Feature: Added an API to provide HTML tags that you want to ignore when pasting HTML.
* Fix: When pasting HTML, and we do an intermediate conversion to Markdown, we now force
  ATX-style headers, which prevents a bug where Setext-style headers were ending up in the
  final document.

## [0.2.8]
### Feb 22, 2026
* Updated `SuperEditorIosControlsControllerWithNativePaste` constructor API to take in
  custom clipboard format inserts, to match the new configuration of `pasteIntoEditorFromNativeClipboard`. 

## [0.2.7]
### Feb 21, 2026
* `pasteIntoEditorFromNativeClipboard` improvements:
  * URL data type is now pasted from clipboard.
  * Plain text uses the standard `super_editor` parser to infer semantics, e.g., parse links.
  * Custom clipboard data inserters can now be provided on a per-format basis instead of just one big custom delegate.
  * When pasting HTML, `<style>` and `<script>` tags are now ignored so that their content is not
    inserted into the document. Any such tags can be listed to be ignored.

## [0.2.6]
### Feb 16, 2026
* Fix method that uses `super_clipboard` to paste ito an `Editor`. Something about how we
  were using the APIs was resulting in mobile paste doing nothing. Now it should be working.

## [0.2.5]
### Jan 28, 2026
* Expose public method for native clipboard pasting into `Editor`: `pasteIntoEditorFromNativeClipboard`.

## [0.2.4]
### Jan 26, 2026
* iOS: Added swizzling to Flutter's iOS delegate that answers the question "is there content to paste?".
       We did this because Flutter only says "yes" when there's text data on the clipboard, but we
       also want to support binary pasting.

## [0.2.3]
### Jan 19, 2026
* **CHANGED PACKAGE TO A PLUGIN**
* iOS: Created plugin that swizzles Flutter's paste behavior and lets your app handle native toolbar pasting.
